***TO DO***

- astnodes for functions, pointers, arrays, struct (last) (John)

- test that symbol table works manually (Colin)
- finish functions for initializing symbol attributes within symbtab.c (Colin)
- function for printing out of the symbol table for checking (Colin)

**LATER**
- incorporate symbol table into parser (Colin + John)
- function to do edge case checks before installing into symbol table (Colin + John)


**LIST TO KEEP TRACK OF STUFF**

- still need to do struct, therefore still no function within symbtab.c to define struct/union symbols and no functionality to insert them into the symbol table
- come back to the decl spec list (6.7.0)
- ignore enums
-
